At Xavier University, we welcome international students every semester, with exchange students, they only stay for 1 semester. This project provides the information of how the price of flight tickets to France, Germany, Spain, South Korean, and Vietnam varies in the period of time (12/13/2024 - 12/20/2024, the end of Fall 2024). I scraped the information of flights from Google Flights, and do analysis on the data set to compare the price by different elements( such as the departure time, the date of the flights, the airlines in charged of operating, the duration, etc.)
